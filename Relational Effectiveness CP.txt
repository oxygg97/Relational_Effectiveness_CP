 - Situation 1:

For me the most difficult thing was to make a good connection with my colleague Taha. 
We weren’t the same “blood group”, had different opinions on many important issues, which resulted in daily conflicts in the workplace. 
Now, I do not want to blame them, or even myself for the situation. 
We simply had a different perspective on many issues, and it showed up in work. 
Eventually I managed to suppress my feelings and ideas, and we somehow cooperated together. 
But it could not work well for long, and I eventually left the company.

 - Situation 2:

The best thing to do in such situations is be open in my communication. If I am simply too busy to help,
communication will ensure that he don’t take my refusal as a personal snub. On the other hand, 
if there’s some bad blood I am unaware of, talking it out can be the first step toward re-initiating 
the office’s spirit of cooperation.
